The following instructions are for creating a developer daily spend report which allows a developer with a sandbox account to received daily emails outlining the amount of spend (cost) their sandbox is incurring. This is similar to the Dev Sandbox alerting but where the alerting emails are sent upon reaching a certain percent of the budget, these daily spend reports are sent each day regardless of the spend and outlines the current running total of spend for the developer and their associated sandbox account.

Steps for Creating a Dev Sandbox Daily Spend Report
The AWS Dev Users budget must already exist or be created. Otherwise, see Creating Dev Sandbox Budgets and Alerts.  
Access the AWS Billing homepage and the 'Budgets Reports' section.
https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/budgets/reports

Example: "Steve Wiemholt Sandbox Daily Budget Report"
Select Budget: Select the one Developer Sandbox budget you need a daily report for.
Choose 'Configure delivery settings' to continue
Report frequency: Daily
Email recipient(s): The corporate email address of the specific developer whose budget you are creating
Choose 'Confirm budget report' to continue
Review the settings and choose 'Done' to continue.
