Problem Statement:
We need to allow only Authorize people to access our Application

Features to be implemented:
       - create a Rest endpoint to validate user
       - if user not exist then return response to signup
       - try allowing maximum attempt for login as 3
       - if it exceed maximum limit of attempt then block that user for 5 minutes

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Pass User information for login in header with encrypt format
2. Provide SSO features
3. User authentication should be done with database
4. Handle proper exception
5. Make hour API completely decoupled
