That said, you already created the ticket (TMOPS-102... this ticket). Next Steps:

1. Please add your ssh-key 4096 key here in this ticket
2. I'll have Gary comment for approval
3. Need you to run the following SQL and send me the resulting HASH
3.1 Run SELECT PASSWORD('mysecretpassword'); on your machine after changing mysecretpassword for your real password.
3.2 Attach the resulting HASH to this ticket.
4. We will add your key to the gitrepos needed
5. You'll setup your DB connection and test after waiting for Gitlab to populate the servers with your key.
