Universal Forwarder installing on linux

Default ports: 8089 for management and 9997 for indexing

Configure receiving 
--Forwarding data to splunk indexer or search head won't work unless you configure that indexer or search head to receive data!

Simply go to 
Settings > Forwarding and Receiving > Add New

Get the IP address or DNS ( Domain Name System) of the required machine.

Install the Universal forwarder in the Linux machine.
Move the folder into Opt directory.

go to cd opt/splukforwarder/bin 
then enter the command
sudo ./splunk enable boot-start --accept-license

sudo ./splunk add forward-server ipaddress:port(192.168.1.1:9997)

check if the added forwarder is attached or not--
command is 
sudo ./splunk list forward-server

It will show configured but inactive forwards
after this we have to add which folder to forward for monitoring purpose, for that command is 
sudo ./splunk add monitor (folder path which need to monitor) /var/log  (for e.g.)

It will still show the cofigured but inactive forwards when you run the command 
sudo ./splunk list forward-server

To overcome this you have to restart the forwarder
sudo ./splunk restart

then it wil work
